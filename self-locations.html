                <h2>Alexandra Amato</h2>
                <p>As someone raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, I was raised by my parents Angela Montgomery and John Amato to continuously learn about the personal history of those around me. I strive to learn as much as I can in the places I have been fortunate enough to live in, and learn about the people I am lucky enough to have put in my life.
                <p>I am currently a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison graduating in May 2025 with a degree in Communication Sciences and Disorders and certificates in Health Policy and American Indian and Indigenous Studies. I am employed by the Pediatric Auditory Experience and Brain Lab under Dr. Carlos Benitez-Barrera. For the past three years, we have been researching questions that impact children with hearing loss and various types of hearing amplifications. Throughout my time at the PAEB Lab, I was able to learn about the funding aspects of research, the permitting side, and the public side of research. This experience will be extremely valuable as I continue my path to securing a health policy certificate as understanding health research is crucial to writing effective health policy.</p>
                <p>I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked on the Oneida Court of Appeals Project. It has provided me invaluable instruction on legal writing and the nuances of tribal appellate proceedings. Thank you for the chance to be a part of this great work!</p>

                <h2>Zoe Armbruster</h2>
                <p>My name is Zoe Armbruster, which means "gift of life." The story of my name reflects a deep connection to the idea of renewal and continuation—an ever-present reminder of the role I play in my family’s legacy and the work I am committed to.</p>
                <p>My ancestors hail from various parts of Europe, including Switzerland, Scotland, Germany, Austria, Poland, France, and the Netherlands. These diverse origins reflect the complexity and broad connections that bind me to different lands and histories. My family is a blend of biological and fictive ties—each one carrying stories, cultures, and values that have shaped me. These ties stretch outward, backward, and across generations, grounding me in a network of histories and experiences.</p>
                <p>My grandfather and his 11 siblings emigrated from Switzerland to the U.S. as young adults. They moved to Wisconsin and established one of the leading cheese factories in the country. Their migration was driven by a combination of opportunity and the ambition to build a new life in America. This journey to Wisconsin marks the starting point of my family’s presence in North America and roots me in the narrative of settler migration, industry, and the pursuit of economic prosperity.</p>
                <p>The land I live and work on, located in Wisconsin, holds a history deeply intertwined with both settler narratives and Indigenous ones. The territory I occupy is part of the land that was originally stewarded by the Anishinaabe, Ho-Chunk, Menominee, and Potawatomi peoples, whose histories, cultures, and rights have been deeply impacted by colonization. While my family’s arrival in this land was driven by a desire to build and create wealth, the ongoing impact of settler colonialism on Indigenous communities remains present. My family’s success in Wisconsin—largely based in agriculture and industry—was built upon a system that disregarded the rights and well-being of Indigenous peoples.</p>
                <p>My ancestors, though they fled war and oppression in Europe, were also beneficiaries of the settler colonial system that displaced Indigenous communities from their ancestral lands. This realization prompts me to consider the ways in which settler colonialism has shaped not only my family’s history but also my own life. The privileges I inherit as part of the settler colonial system compel me to question how I can use my position and knowledge to advocate for justice and decolonization.</p>
                <p>As I continue my studies and work in the legal field, especially with the Tribal Court of Appeals, I must engage critically with my role in this broader historical context. I hold a responsibility to acknowledge the harm caused by colonization, both in terms of land dispossession and the erasure of Indigenous cultures. At the same time, I am committed to amplifying Indigenous voices, advocating for sovereignty and justice, and decolonizing the legal systems that perpetuate systemic violence. My journey is one of understanding my privilege, my roots, and the role I play in reshaping the future of justice for all communities.</p>

                <h2>Wrigley Bastian</h2>
                <p>My name is Wrigley Bastian. Christinia Cherry, my mother, made sure I faced the east when I was born. It was important to her; she wanted me to be blessed with many good beginnings and few bad endings. She is a strong Ojibwe Kwe who is a part of The Stolen Generation. She helps me be the best version of myself.  Paul Bastian, my father, loves me the best that he can and makes sure I will always be happy. He is a stubborn man who teaches me to follow my heart and be kind. Camden Bastian and Easton Bastian are my supportive and brave younger siblings, whom I will always protect.</p>
                <p>I grew up in many places, never staying in one spot for too long. It can be challenging to feel connected to an area when you know you will leave soon. Despite this I have gotten to know the areas of Wisconsin that I have lived in with the fondness of a friend.</p>
                <p>I was in poverty for most of my younger years and it has taught me to love and respect every being. From the protection of the trees to the birds with their songs and the abundance of the lakes. Due to the support of family and friends I am free and able to be myself. With my zest for life, justice, learning, reading, music, small moments, my Native Heritage, and more, it is hard for me not to find joy.</p>
                <p>I am a first-year student getting my undergraduate degree at the University of Wisconsin Madison where I study English, Law, and Native American studies. My dream is to be able to ask people “how can I help?” and be able to help. The transition to college from high school was challenging but knowing that I had so many people behind me to support me, those passed and those present, made it worthwhile. At college I have been able to learn more about myself and my values as a Native American student and I cannot wait to see what the future here brings.</p>
                <p>I am thankful for the opportunity to work with the tribes of this project. It was a great experience, and it is one that I will carry with me into the future.</p>

            <section id="Helena Bello">
                <h2>Helena Bello</h2>
                <p>My name is Helena Bello. Before coming to Madison for college, I had lived my whole life in Washington, DC on the lands of the Nacotchtank (Anacostan) people. I am of mixed heritage — half-Mexican and half-white (German/English/Irish) — and I carry with me the histories and cultures that come from both sides of my family.</p>
                <p>As a student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, I live and learn on Ho-Chunk land, the ancestral home of the Ho-Chunk Nation. I recognize the ongoing presence of Indigenous peoples here and honor the long-standing stewardship they have provided to this land. Additionally, as someone who hopes to pursue a career in environmental law, I understand that protecting the environment cannot be separated from respecting Indigenous sovereignty and learning from Indigenous knowledge. Indigenous communities have cared for the land since time immemorial, and their stewardship offers important strategies and knowledge that can be applied to many environmental issues. This class has provided many learning opportunities about Indigenous values - the 4 R's for example (Responsibility, Respect, Relationality and Reciprocity), and these can be used to implement environmental protection strategies that are equitable and just.</p>
                <p>As I continue on my career path towards becoming a lawyer, I will bring with me the lessons I've learned in this class and I hope to learn more lessons from Indigenous people in the future. Bringing these lessons and values with me is incredibly important as I am committed to listening, supporting sovereignty, and applying these lessons and values in my future work. I am thankful that I have had the past semester (and Fall 2025 semester!) to work on this project, to learn more about Oneida law & culture, and to gain knowledge and lessons that will stick with me.</p>

                <h2>Ella Buffalo</h2>
                <p>My name is Ella Buffalo. I come from my mother, Beth Buffalo, who has taught me to always be kind and to see situations from multiple perspectives. I also come from my father, Henry Buffalo III, who has taught me to voice my opinion and be a leader. I always try my hardest to fulfill my roles as Daughter, Granddaughter, Sister, Friend, Scholar, Learner, Researcher, and many more with grace and respect.</p>
                <p>I come from the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. I also come from my grandfather, Henry Buffalo Jr., who is a tribal judge and attorney. He has taught me and his other grandchildren much about our background and culture, as well as about his work and the legacy he has left behind.</p>
                <p>I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I have always been fascinated by the law, specifically Tribal Law. That is exactly why I am a part of the Oneida Tribal Court of Appeals Research Project. I love that I am able to interact with Tribal law on such a level and I cannot wait to see where the future brings me. I am (hopefully) a future law student. I hope to use this incredible experience from my undergraduate years in my future scholarship and career.</p>

            <section id="Eleanor Buono">
                <h2>Eleanor Buono</h2>
                <p>My name is Eleanor Buono, and I come from a close-knit family that has shaped my values and identity in profound ways. I am the daughter of Rob and Liz and the younger sister of Grace. Beyond these immediate bonds, I cherish my roles as a granddaughter, cousin, niece, and friend to the many other important people in my life. My heritage reflects a blend of Italian ancestry from my father’s side and both Irish and Italian roots from my mother’s. This cultural combination has profoundly influenced my sense of family identity, fostering values, traditions, and a deep appreciation for togetherness.</p>
                <p>One tradition that stands at the heart of my family’s core is the ritual of family dinners—a shared cornerstone of both my parents’ upbringing. Growing up, the four of us would gather around the dinner table every evening, a special space where we shared our days, discussed current events, and simply enjoyed each other's company. Once a week, our table grew larger as we welcomed extended family and friends, creating a space filled with laughter, connection, and love. While the physical dinner table varied over the years, it was never about where we sat but who was there. These meals taught me an invaluable lesson: relationships are sacred. No matter who sat at our dinner table, they were always welcomed, and it was here that I first learned the importance of hearing diverse perspectives and opinions. These conversations were as educational as any classroom setting, offering lessons in curiosity, empathy, and understanding. I often came to the table with questions and curiosities from my day, eager to learn more. My parents instilled in my sister and me the value of keeping an open mind and seeking out new knowledge every day.</p>
                <p>This mindset has carried into my academic journey, where I have sought out courses that challenge me and introduce new ideas. When my advisor mentioned the opportunity to take a class on Tribal Courts, I was immediately intrigued, as tribal law was a topic I had never encountered in my studies. Through this experience, I have gained insight into an entirely new sector of law, learning how to analyze complex legal cases and distill them into clear, accessible explanations. This project has deepened my understanding of the law’s power to educate and connect people from all walks of life.</p>

            <section id="Abhita Chakravarti">
                <h2>Abhita Chakravarti</h2>
                <p>My name is Abhita Chakravarti. I was born in Philadelphia, PA and grew up mostly in the Chicago suburbs. My parents are both from India, but my dad was born in West Bengal and my mom was born in Dundee, Illinois. My heritage is rooted between two cultures with one in India and one in America. Growing up, I learned how to navigate and respect the traditions, values, and expectations of both worlds.</p>
                <p>Living in this middle ground has shaped who I am. It taught me to be open minded, adaptable, and aware that there are many different ways of seeing and experiencing the world. This has also made me realize how much privilege I carry by growing up in the U.S., and how important it is to recognize the histories of the land I live on. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I study Political Science and Global Economics. I understand that my opportunity to learn here is because of the Ho-Chunk Nation, who lived on this land long before colonization. Knowing that I benefit from these systems pushes me to keep learning and support Indigenous rights whenever I can.</p>
                <p>Community has always been an important part of my life, especially through my large extended family, who I rely on for support and advice. Beyond family, I have built community through my involvement in voter organizations, my work in legal research, and my time on a dance team where teamwork and a shared goal have made friends into family. This reminds me that my identity is not something I build alone, but something shaped by the people, places, and histories I am connected to.</p>
                <p>As I continue my education and work, I am committed to learning, building strong relationships, and giving back to the communities that support me. I am grateful for the people and places that have shaped me, and I hope to move forward in ways that show care and respect for both my roots and the land I am on.</p>

                <p>Born and raised in Los Angeles, California by a successful businessman, stay-at-home mother, and three overbearing older brothers. My life before college consisted of music, a passion for history, and the need for constant noise.</p> 
                <p>I am currently a senior in college with graduation fast approaching. I am graduating with a degree in Consumer Behavior and will continue my academic career in law school. Following my passion for music I hope to study entertainment law. I want to be an entertainment lawyer so that I can help musicians protect themselves in a tough industry, while also lifting their careers so they can share their passion with others.</p>
                <p>Throughout my college career, I have been able to meet new people, experience a new place, and learn beyond the classroom. All of my experiences have taught me how to be independent and self-sufficient while learning to lean on support systems and community. I have experienced several support systems in college, including teachers, friends, mentors, and self-confidence. Now, as graduation is in my sights, I feel a more accurate sense of independence. I have learned that independence is not about being alone but being able to surround yourself with people who support you and give you a safety net while you learn and grow. </p>
                <p>I continue to learn and grow as my academic career continues and find that self-definitions are always changing. I have experienced different phases in life and continue to update my self-identification as I become older and slightly wiser. I am grateful for my experience in this course and the chance to grow and learn from a different community.</p>

            <section id="Ashley Green">
                <h2>Ashley Green</h2>
                <p>My name is Ashley Green. I was born in St. Paul, Minnesota and raised in a suburb nearby called Woodbury. My mother is also from Minnesota; her parents came here from Texas so my grandfather could play football for Michigan State and eventually the Minnesota Vikings. My father was born and raised in Lafayette, Louisiana, and moved to Minnesota for law school. He is a district court judge, while my mother works for the state of Minnesota as the Director of the Crime Victim Reparations. My parents both worked very hard for their positions, both earning J.D.s from the University of Minnesota Law School.</p>
                <p>I am a Black woman with roots in the deep south. Since my family is primarily from Louisiana and Texas, I have Creole ancestry. I grew up in a predominantly white suburb, but surrounded myself with a diverse group of people anyways. The history of my people partially shaped who I am as a persoon, and I have always been instrumental in fighting for the rights of Black and Brown people. I am also part of the LGBT+ community, so I experience the intersection of both racially marginalized and sexually marginalized identities at once.</p>
                <p>I am a senior legal studies and journalism double major with a concentration on criminal justice. I acknowledge that the history of my people and the indigenous people are similar for many reasons, and I wish I could say the reasons are positive. We have a shared history of struggle, subjugation and the oppression of our cultures and values. To this day, our people are systematically marginalized and kept from equal opportunities. However, as a woman who grew up on stolen land, it is my responsibility to acknowledge the differences in our histories and actively do my part to help repair the harm caused to the indigenous peoples. I live in solidarity with those communities, and I view my commitment to righting the wrongs of the past as a great strength.</p>
                <p>My career aspirations revolve around the responsibility I feel I have to my community. I want to reform the criminal justice system, particularly as it pertains to historically underrepresented populations. I hope to provide counsel, support, and resources to those affected by it, as well as work alongside programs that focus on restorative justice as a means of preventing vulnerable communities from getting caught up in the legal system.</p>

                <h2>Carol Gross</h2>
                <p>My name is Carol Gross, and I was born in St. Paul, Minnesota to my parents Michael and Sandra Gross. I have one older brother Sid, who has always been very good to me, no matter how annoying he could be at times. Growing up I was forced to spend all my time outside. At the time, I was a little embarrassed to have parents who, if the sun was out even slightly, made me and my friends play outside. It even became a joke among my friends that if we wanted to play something inside, we couldn’t go to my house. In retrospect, I am so glad I had all of those years connecting with nature and growing up in the grass. Especially now as a senior in college who spends most of her days locked in a library staring at her computer, it is nice to reminisce.</p>
                <p>My favorite thing to do is swim and I swam competitively most of my life. While I loved to compete and I treasure every time I get to be in the water, I feel a deeper connection to natural bodies of water. My mom raised me on the belief that you should never pass up the opportunity to jump in water whenever it is presented to you, and I stick to this philosophy religiously. I’ve swam in all kinds of bodies of water from the Mediterranean Sea to Norwegian fjords to glacial lakes in the boundary waters. As fortunate as I am to have had these experiences, nothing will beat swimming lazily in a Minnesota lake on a hot summer day with my family.</p>
                <p>For me, water is a form of renewal and swimming is ritualistic in a way. In our last in-person class we talked a lot about the importance of water and our connection to it, which felt very affirming for me. Having something so specific and tangible as a reminder to ground myself in the moment has been very important in my life. Through this project I have learned more ways to ground myself. It has been nice to have a form of work every week that’s different than my other classes and in a way doing casework has been a form of renewal. I’ve tried to approach this work with a sense of gratefulness, mindfulness, and empathy as this is a time my work can make an actual impact on people. I am very grateful for this opportunity and have learned a lot about legal work, tribal law, and Indigenous ways of knowing.</p>

                <h2>Mathilde Hardy</h2>
                <p>I’ve grown up moving through different “bubbles of life”, as I like to call them. My first was when I lived in France, where my mom is from, for 6 years of my life. We then moved back to Edina, my “second bubble”, where I have lived close to my dad’s family for the past 16 years of my life. This put much distance between one important part of my identity: my indigeneity and connection to my ancestors of White Earth in northern Minnesota. Although the distance was shortened once we moved back, the Edina bubble felt much more sheltered and protected which is something I grew up to understand later on. Because of this, I felt disconnected from some parts of my identity including my indigenous identity. My grandpa also dealt with much generational trauma in his childhood that he rarely spoke about so I didn’t get as many opportunities to learn from him, understandably.</p>
                <p>When I reached my teens I still lacked a complete understanding and acceptance of my indigenous identity and it bothered me because I felt lost. However, my parents continuously taught me to follow my intuition and to never stop exploring. That’s what I’ve been doing ever since: seeking as many new opportunities and experiences that help me grow, especially in understanding my ancestors' past and culture. I joined the Indigenous Club at my high school and participated/volunteered with the Division of Indian Work in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I’ve also grown to enjoy traveling very much especially while at UW-Madison with the opportunity to study abroad twice and pursue a major in International Studies. It’s given me a profound perspective of the world while getting to know people of various backgrounds and cultures. One of my favorite memories is connecting with the indigenous people of Patagonia in Argentina who also endured a terrible history of violence and continued discrimination. I had the incredible chance to interview them and present their story at a research symposium. </p>
                <p>My continued curiosity is also thanks to the amazing professors I’ve learned from and of course, being part of the Oneida Tribal Court of Appeals Project with Michael. It allowed me to understand another complicated yet very interesting aspect of tribal function, especially when it comes to its legal system, which is something I knew very little about. Overall, it was an honor to be able to contribute to this project that taught me valuable analytical and reflective skills. I am excited to see how the project continues to serve the Oneida Tribe for years to come, so thank you for a wonderful experience!</p>

                <h2>Nasra Hassen</h2>
                <p>My name is Nasra Hassen. I am from Minneapolis, Minnesota, but I was born in Jigjiga, in the Ogadenia region of Ethiopia. Before settling in Ogadenia—our tribal homeland, which was taken by Ethiopia during the Somali-Ethiopian war—my grandparents lived in Somalia. They were forced to flee due to the conflict and resettled in Ogadenia after the war. My family is full Somali, and from a young age, I was taught to value and remember my lineage. This was something my grandfather instilled in me early on, emphasizing that my heritage was an essential part of who I am and something I must carry with me wherever I go. By the age of six, I could trace my ancestry back to my eighth great-grandfather. When I was eight years old, my family left Ethiopia and immigrated to the United States in search of better opportunities. We moved three times before finally settling in Minnesota. As an immigrant, adjusting to life in America was difficult—learning a new culture and language was challenging, and confronting the reality that skin color carried a different weight here than it did back home was even harder.</p>
                <p>With all the identities I carry, I made a promise to always advocate for others. This passion led me to pursue law. I wanted to understand the intricacies of the law and how it affects every individual in this country. Beyond that, I sought to learn how America, as a global power, impacts people beyond its borders. I learned about the history of Indigenous peoples in America and the horrific treatment they endured at the hands of white settlers. I understood the pain, anger, and resentment—emotions my grandparents often expressed when speaking about the history and current state of Somalia and Ogadenia. This understanding motivated me to take courses focused on Indigenous law and culture. I wanted to deepen my knowledge of the relationship between Indigenous legal systems and American law, and to broaden my understanding of Indigenous communities. As someone who is passionate about learning about different cultures and histories, this was a perfect opportunity.</p>
                <p>Now, as I near the end of my time at UW–Madison, my career goals have changed. Although I no longer plan to become a lawyer, my commitment to advocating for others and being a voice for those who need one has only grown stronger. My eagerness to explore the world, to learn about diverse cultures, and to meet people from every corner of the globe remains unwavering. No matter which career path I ultimately pursue—even if it is far from the legal field—this mission and passion will always be at the heart of everything I do.</p>

                <h2>Sara Hegde</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Sara Hegde, and I come from a close family of my mother, Karla, and my father, Hemant. I am also the younger sister of Alyssa and Neil. I was born in Ogden, Utah, and moved to Eau Claire, Wisconsin at age five. My parents come from different cultural backgrounds, and have taught me to be open-minded and considerate of others who have different experiences. Growing up in a mixed culture household has had its challenges, but I think it has made me a better person. I am limited in my knowledge of the land I reside on, but I hope to grow in my understanding and appreciation of it. This land was the land of Indigenous people, and acknowledging that as much as I can is a goal of mine, especially as I benefit from the effects of colonialism and displacement.</p>
                <p>Much of my current responsibilities are with education. I am currently a Legal Studies and Sociology major. My Sociology major especially has taught me a lot about people and different cultures and behaviors. Along with my studies, I have also had the opportunity through UW-Madison to be a part of Alternative Breaks. This club is a community service club, and it has taught me a lot about communities, and the best way to involve yourself within them. I have found a great community of people within Alternative Breaks, and the Wisconsin Union Directorate. Through both of these groups, I have been welcomed, and have learned how to create welcoming spaces for others.</p>
                <p>I also work as a camp counselor. The camp I work at resides on Anishinaabe land, and is something I need to continuously acknowledge, and teach to the children I take care of. The camp is in New Auburn, WI, on Long Lake. Working as a camp counselor has shown me the importance of kindness and patience. Both are things that I hope to continue working on throughout life.</p>
                <p>In the fall I will continue my schooling. I know that there will be many new challenges, but I know that what I have learned, and the communities I've been able to take part in will ground me. Thanks to my time at UW-Madison, I have grown a lot as a person, and expanded upon what I've learned in childhood and from my family. This class especially has shown me a lot, from a technical standpoint, as well as a holistic one. Whether it be learning about passive voice, or taking breaths before class, everything I've learned has been invaluable. I am incredibly grateful, and thank you so much for this opportunity!</p>

                <h2>Lauren Jentsch</h2>
                <p>My name is Lauren Jentsch. I was raised just outside of Milwaukee in New Berlin, Wisconsin, a place we referred to as a bubble growing up. My parents grew up on family farms that have since disappeared, and chose to move to the city. My family is firmly middle-class, with my mom working as a public school teacher and my dad being a self-employed website developer. Both of them prioritized their work passions and love growing up, teaching my sister and I to do the same as we explored our future careers.</p>
                <p>As a white woman, I have inherent privileges and access to many opportunities in life. Having grown up in a bubble and predominantly white community, I lacked exposure to alternate viewpoints and my knowledge of history contains gaps that I continuously work to educate myself on. My community growing up lacked information on traditional, values, and responsibilities of other cultures and communities.</p>
                <p>I am a sophomore getting my degree in Political Science and Legal Studies at University of Wisconsin - Madison, an institution that reflects many of the same issues as my hometown. My goal is to preserve the love of learning about other people and their stories, and the land we occupy. The land my family has occupied is land that did not belong to us and was taken by force through various colonial governments. The first generations of my family came to Wisconsin for economic opportunity and benefitted from systems that privileged their European status. In my education, I use my family history to connect with questioning the system I was raised in while exploring how to use my voice to increase awareness of others’ stories for people who grew up in similar communities to mine.</p>
                <p>As I continue my work in the legal field, I acknowledge the necessity of working within the broader historical context, holding myself responsible to challenge colonial viewpoints and maintaining space for Indigenous voices, while also being conscious of the space I occupy as a professional and as a person. I hope to continue to engage with the community I have found as part of this project and beyond. I am thankful for the opportunities I’ve had access to so far and hope to help provide the same opportunities to the generations of lawyers and scholars that come after me.</p>

                <p>I was born into a Russian and Jewish American family and raised in Parsippany, New Jersey. Growing up, my family instilled in me the values of openness, community, and service.

                <p>Currently, I am a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I will be graduating in May. I am passionate about my majors in Psychology and Legal Studies and am exploring ways to combine these interests as I consider my future career path.</p>

                <h2>Ethan Ladd</h2>
                <p>hello and best wishes. I am from my mother and father, Donna and Andrew Ladd, who raised me to be a leader in my community. As a son, brother, nephew, uncle, student, community member, and myself, I attempt to lead through example. With the morality my parents instilled in my soul, I govern myself with the basic tenets of respect for others, respect for myself, kindness, compasion, loyalty, hard work, dedication to love, and basic decency.</p>
                <p>I grew up in Waukesha, Wisconsin, in the same childhood home that raised my two older brothers. I frequented a few other places on an annual basis that I also consider home, including Minocqua, Wisconsin, to fish and enjoy the North Woods, and Negril, Jamaica, where I became fond of the ocean, sand and beaches, Jamaican people and culture, and different cuisine. Additionally, I call Spring Green, Wisconsin, home. I grew up visiting my grandfather who lived on eighty acres in Sauk County. This home is where I developed respect for nature: its liveliness; its creatures; its sounds, sights and smells; and its sense of solitude, self-reflection, and growth. At the same time, my family occupies land that, for centuries, was lived on and respected by thousands of indigenous peoples before me. This home is where I have come to evaluate colonial procurement of land and its artificial designation of “private property.”</p>
                <p>Currently, I am enrolled in Legal Studies 400 at the University of Wisconsin–Madison where I’ve continued to develop a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between indigenous peoples and the colonial land structure I’ve inherited. I work part-time at the Wisconsin Historical Society Press. As a marketing employee in the book industry, I’ve developed a deeper understanding of Wisconsin’s history, including both the people who have inhabited the region for the past two centuries and the people who have raised their children here for thousands of years. My education and career both reflect a deep passion for history. At the same time, however, history has led me to develop a sense of justice and injustice, and pursue a future where I can become a dynamic individual that works towards a better version of humanity.</p>
                <p>I am pursuing a J.D. degree from the University of Wisconsin Law School. I hope to continue my education in both history and justice through studying law. Though my future is uncertain, and I am unsure what my career may entail, I strongly believe that I will continue to develop as a leader, community member, and advocate for justice until my life concludes. In the near future, I am committed to working with Tribal Nations as both a state employee, publishing books on Indigenous history, and as a project member in the Court of Appeals Project. In both the present and future, I am committed to learning from diverse voices who have often been marginalized throughout recent colonial times. In the extended future, I am committed to advocating for justice and making an impact on my community to better understand past injustices and work towards a future in which everyone may peacefully coexist.</p>

                <p>My name is Jakob Mills. I am a white, cisgender, heterosexual male of European ancestry. I have inherent white and male privilege, and so I must use the power this privilege gives me to assist in the creation of a learning, work, and societal environment that is inclusive and welcoming to all. I am a descendant of English, German, Irish, and Swedish settlers who came to the American continent over the past few centuries. While these nationalities represent the peoples my ancestors belonged to, I share a limited cultural connection to these regions today and am an American. I recognize that while I am American by birth, this identity is the result of centuries of oppression, forced relocation, and many other atrocities. Thus, it is my responsibility as an American to learn about these atrocities, acknowledge them, and keep them from being repeated.</p>
                <p>I am a scientist, someone passionate about justice and the fair application of the law and society, and a teacher and communicator. It is my responsibility to educate myself, interact with all in good faith, and work to check my biases and other assumptions. Further, I am responsible for using the power that I have to better the spaces I inhabit. In science, this means committing myself to learning more about the universe around me. In legal studies, this means approaching things from an objective, open mindset determined to understand others' experiences and work to better them. In teaching and science communication, this means to meet every person where they are at and work to make science accessible to them. Before any of this work can begin, it is my responsibility to care for my own physical and mental well-being so that I may approach each situation with as open, kind, attentive, and thoughtful a mind as possible.</p>

                <p>My name is Maggie Munson. I am primarily an English and Irish woman who comes from farmers and teachers, who helped instill the value of hard work, and academics and scientists, who taught me the value of curiosity. My last name, Munson, means “truth conquers all.” I hope to always seek the truth and serve others.</p>
                <p>I come from seven generations of Wisconsinites, and I grew up in Plymouth, Wisconsin, a rural area of the state. Though I know it as Plymouth, the Menominee nation called it Quit Qui Oc (land along the crooked river) since time immemorial. My grandmother, a fifth-generation Wisconsinite who spent time growing up on a farm, knows a plethora of Wisconsin’s plants, birds, fish, and animals. She passed much of this knowledge down to me. I recognize that what I have learned about the land from seven generations pales in comparison to indigenous knowledge accumulated over thousands of years. I also recognize that my ancestors contributed to the decline and decimation of indigenous people and cultures. As I grew up, my grandmother tried to keep indigenous knowledge alive by taking me to museums curated by indigenous people and a powwow in Lac du Flambeau. These experiences inspired me to take Legal Studies 400.</p>
                <p>Today, I am a senior triple-majoring in political science, legal studies, and history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am also a varsity student-athlete in cross country and track here. I decided to work on the Tribal Court of Appeals Project by enrolling in Legal Studies 400. During this project, I read and analyzed Oneida Appeals Court cases and volunteered at Midwest Environmental Advocates (MEA) environmental law firm. At MEA, I got to help build their social media outreach and work on publicizing issues like Line 5 and PFAS. When I told my grandmother that I would be analyzing court cases for the Oneida Nation, she was excited, and we had deeper conversations about the histories of native nations.</p>
                <p>Throughout the semester, she mailed me newspaper and magazine clippings she read about indigenous history around Plymouth and Lac du Flambeau. Working on this project allowed me to serve the Oneida Nation and grow my legal analysis skills, but it also strengthened my relationship with my grandmother.</p>

                <p>My name is Lauren Noble. I was born and raised in Kenosha, WI, on the shores of Lake Michigan. My mother was born in London, but ethnically, my family ancestry is the typical mix of Western European countries you often hear from white Americans. In my case, mainly Irish, Italian, and German heritage. But I mostly refer to myself as white. From a socio-cultural standpoint, I acknowledge the inherent privileges that looking the way I do has afforded me. And the privileges passed down to me from a colonial history of white dominance. Along with this, I find it important to recognize that the school I attend rests on the land of the Ho-Chunk people. While my ancestry has benefited from (and possibly perpetuated) the colonization of Natives, I must recognize, take responsibility, and do everything I can to promote tribal sovereignty.</p>
                <p>While I didn't leave my home state for college, I have been extremely blessed to travel far and often. Having been to over thirty countries, living in Paris, and gearing up to live abroad again have been some of my life's greatest gifts. I have always been drawn to experiencing other cultures, whether that be volunteering with a native youth project on the Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota, teaching English in Thailand, desert camping in Morocco, or doing legal work for the Oneida Appellate Court system. My thirst for new experiences has taken me to some interesting places, gaining culturally-sensitive knowledge that would not be otherwise accessible.</p>
                <p>I hope this drive for cultural empathy will continue throughout my legal career. I think being an educated global citizen should be at the forefront of all attorneys' minds. This is why this class is so important to me. Learning and understanding the 4 R's of Indigenous values (Responsibility, Respect, Relationality, and Reciprocity) will be useful in whatever legal path I find myself. I think the skills law school teaches you are extremely valuable. It is a person's responsibility to use those skills to further the greater good. Michael has taught us that the legal profession is a great tool for making connections, building community, and promoting accessibility for others. With the skills and knowledge gained in this course,  I hope to do just that in my future legal career.</p>

My father, also named Christopher was born and raised in Wisconsin to a Menominee mother. My mother Holly Harris Rajchel was born in the state Mississippi to a primarily Irish and Welsh family as were her parents. I have a sister named Ari who I cherish in every memory growing up together. Most of the time I rarely identify with race (usually others decide that) but when I do I say I am mixed, though usually I prefer Menominee and/or Irish-American. Heritage if you cant already tell is heavily emphasized in both sides of my family and has given me a great appreciation for both my personal history as well as the histories of others.</p>
                <p>I am a son, a brother, and a student who has been blessed to spend a lot of my life in different circumstances and places which has cemented curiosity and understanding as values that I live for. These experiences of both privilege and hardship at times have shaped me into a person who aspires to be fair minded and just. I value the collection of context and perspectives from as many people as possible for its own sake. But I was also taught by my family to give back in almost anyway I can to the people and communities that are gracious enough to teach me.</p>
                <p>I have been again blessed to be a student here for a short 2 years studying legal studies and policy, with aspirations for law school. Here  I could also interact with and contribute to the different communities on campus and in the wider city. I took this opportunity with the Oneida Appellate Court as a last way to take advantage of this schools connections to do a little bit for a community I wouldn't have usually interacted with. The Native community on campus has readily opened itself to me so I saw this as a way of repaying that as well. This project has given me practical skills and a sense of fulfillment that I haven't gotten with most of my other classes here. All for the small contribution of my time toward a project that truly evokes student passion and contributes to real gains in tribal sovereignty. I am happy to know that the skills I have gained in this class and project will be put to further use for other communities and people as I progress into a legal career.</p>

While I don’t plan on utilizing all of these skills long-term, it provides financial flexibility and teaches me interpersonal skills.</p>

                <p>I felt that this class would allow me to combine a few different interests. I did not previously have experience working with Indigenous groups from Wisconsin. However, I thought the opportunity to learn about a new culture and possibly help them while expanding my legal knowledge would be an amazing opportunity.</p>

I was raised in Northern India, living in Dharamshala–a small town in the Himalayan Ranges–and in Dehradun, a city in the Himalayan foothills. For most of my life, I have lived close to nature. I grew up in a home near a forest in India, where the chirping of the birds and the sound of a nearby river were always in the background. Since moving to the U.S five years ago, I’ve lived in Colorado, near the Rockies in the suburbs of Boulder, where the pine trees and mountains reminded me of the Himalayas. I now call Madison, Wisconsin my home. Here, I enjoy sitting on the banks of Lake Mendota and walking along its shores. I cannot imagine a life away from the mountains, trees, and water. If I cannot be close to all of them, I at least need to be near one.</p>
                <p>As a Tibetan, I was raised with the values of kindness, generosity, and empathy. My family also emphasized the importance of following one’s passions and giving back to the community in our own unique ways, whatever those may be. I have been privileged to witness strong role models within my community–people who documented Tibetan history, stood up against oppression, advocated for victims of domestic abuse, and founded schools for children of Tibetan and Himalayan descent to preserve our language, culture, and traditions. These interactions have greatly shaped who I am today.</p>
                <p>I identify as Tibetan-Indian, a woman, a daughter, a sister, an aunt, and a friend. Growing up in a country where violence against women is a daily reality, I care deeply about advocating for victims of abuse and for individuals from minority communities, many of whom have been pushed to the margins of society. I am currently pursuing a BA at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, majoring in Legal studies and a certificate in History. I will graduate in May 2025. Through my studies, I have developed a strong interest in reforming the U.S Criminal Justice System. In the summer of 2025, I am excited to intern at EXPO (Ex-incarcerate People Organizing), a non-profit organization that supports ex-incarcerated individuals as they reintegrate into society. EXPO also provides transitional housing for ex-incarcerated women who are far more likely to suffer abuse than the general population. In my future work, I hope to continue combining these two passions–criminal justice reform and advocacy for victims of abuse.</p>

                <h2>Amaya White</h2>
                <p>I am Amaya White, a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying Legal Studies and obtaining certificates in Criminal Justice and Educational Policy. I am planning on attending law school post graduation in order to fulfill my lifelong goal of entering a career where I serve others, which I plan to do with my J.D.</p>
                <p>My interest in serving others, especially minorities, stems from my life experiences where I have had the opportunity to work with and experience several different walks of life. I grew up in Lac du Flambeau, Wisconsin, which is a small reservation nestled in the woods of Northern Wisconsin. I am an Indigenous woman, as my parents are both Indigenous and grew up on the same reservation. As a child I grew up somewhat poor with my parents and at the time my two siblings. My mother worked very hard and got a degree in nursing from a local community college when I was about 5 or 6. This provided us with many more opportunities, which I am grateful for. My mother working as a nurse and my father working provided us stability. Two years ago, she received her masters degree and is a nurse practitioner, which has opened plenty of new doors for our family which we previously did not have. Growing up on a reservation, I have experienced pervasive struggles such as watching others struggle with addiction and premature death..</p>
                <p>The struggles I have witnessed have provided me with an important tool: resilience. Resilience has gotten me through everything so far, and has landed me here, working with the Tribal Court of Appeals Project. My interest in working with the Oneida Nation and the Tribal Court of Appeals Project stems from a sense of familiarity and desire to serve those similar to me. Working with a tribe and Indigenous people allows me to work with material and concepts that I am familiar with and have an interest in. This Project represents me in a lot of ways, in terms of growth, personal experience, and racial background. I am fortunate to be able to help tribes and groups who have inadequate support and resources, as I come from almost a similar background. Working on this project reminds me to be grateful for everything that I have gotten through to be here and to be thankful to have made it through struggles.</p>

                <p>Aaniin, my name is Miinan White and I have been fortunate enough to have parents Brandy and Odawa White.  My nani Brandy has shown me selflessness, passion, and determination.  My father Odawa pushes me to be my best self and would do anything to ensure my happiness in life.</p>
                <p>I am an enrolled member of the Ho-Chunk Nation and have strong roots in the LCO Band of Superior Ojibwe.  There, I am a lifelong learner in our traditional ways and am forever grateful to be able to follow the ways of my grandparents and their grandparents.  I am constantly learning from my grandparents who teach at the LCO schools as well as my parents who work for the tribal college.</p>
                <p>I am currently an undergraduate in my junior year here at UW Madison.  I am studying legal studies with certificates of policy and American Indian studies.  My goals in life are to work in the legal field to better my community.  I enjoy learning about business law as well criminal law.  I have interned under Native Law Group and worked for the Ho-Chunk Nation over the summer.</p>
                <p>I took this class last spring to better my legal writing and learn from a tribal court to understand the intricacies.  From this, I was able to better my legal writing and connect with community members, professors, and students.</p>

                <p>Michael Williams ni: yukyats. Wakeskle:wake niwaki’talo:tʌ. Onʌyoteˀa·ká· ni·i. Taluʔkowanhné Kawyhuhatati nu: teknakehle. I am from my mother, Jacqueline Gerhardt, who raised me to be a peaceful person. I attempt to perpetuate peace while enacting my roles as Husband, Father, Son, Brother, Uncle, Learner, Scholar, Researcher, Education Facilitator, Attorney, Developer, Entrepreneur, Musician, Artist, Gamer, Community Servant and Myself.</p>
                <p>I was born in Milwaukee, where I have precious collection of memories with my mother, and two sisters, Katelyn Popp (then, Garza) and Skylur Jensen. I grew up on the Oneida Reservation in one of our “Sites” of Department of Housing and Urban Development – HUD Housing. In childhood, I spent my time running through the woods, chasing my cat, playing with my dog, riding bikes with my friends, playing board games with my family, and playing video games on my PlayStation 2. I went to school off-reservation at Seymour Community School District. I met many amazing teachers there who helped me foster a love of learning and community. Teachers like Mrs. Cartier, Mr. Lowney, Mr. Butch, Mr. Vine, Mrs. Tupper, Mr. Thompson, Mrs. Jelenic, Ms. Druckery, Mrs. Bucheger, Mrs. Lemke, and Mrs. Harpold all developed my ability to engage with school and develop as a person. From elementary school to high school, I stayed very involved: Soccer, Destination Imagination, Forensics, Basketball, Solo & Ensemble, Musical, and Yearbook. Additionally, I worked throughout middle school and high school as a babysitter, dishwasher, busser, runner, McDonald’s crew and crew trainer. While in high school, I attended the Information Technology Academy, which provided me academic pre-college training, technology skills training and an admission-conditioned scholarship to the University of Wisconsin Madison. Through the program, I learned to develop websites, program computers, use professional photography equipment, and design illustrations.</p>
                <p>After graduating high school in 2017, I traveled from Oneida to UW-Madison. At UW-Madison, I gained a new community and many new resources of institutional knowledges. As a student, I worked for the Information Technology Academy to teach their technology curriculum, and during my time, I redeveloped the python programming courses, started their livestreaming services, and supported their Indigenization efforts. I also was paid as an officer of Wunk Sheek, the Indigenous student organization that hosted 90+ events and 3 powwows during my tenure on leadership. My college path allowed me to spend 1 year researching trust in journalism with Dr. Susan Robinson, spend two years studying Hoocąk (the Ho-Chunk language), spend two years studying Anishinaabemowin (the Ojibwe language), spend three years on the planning committee of the On Wisconsin Annual Spring Powwow, and spend 1 year researching perceived racial misclassifications with Dr. Anna Fetter. And in 2021, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology and Certificate in American Indian Studies. </p>
                <p>After graduating, I was accepted to UW-Madison Law School. Before attending law school, I completed a preparatory program from the American Indian Law Center (AILC) called the Pre-Law Summer Institute (PLSI). In the summer after my first-year of law school, I worked with the PLSI teaching incoming law students the basics of Civil Procedure, Constitutional Law, and Federal Indian Law. My second year of law school, I worked with the UW Law School Family Court Clinic, and Family Legal Advocacy and Support Clinic to help individuals with family law issues. Also in my second year, I earned the highest grade in Federal Indian Law with Professor Richard Monette. In my final year, I began working with the Open Law Library and developed the Tribal Court of Appeals Project. Throughout all of law school, I participated in the Indigenous Law Students Association, and helped plan the Coming Together of Peoples Conference (CTOPC), the longest-running, student-led, free Indigenous Law Conference in the nation.</p>
                <p>Currently, I work full-time with the Open Law Library. As a Codification Attorney, I work with governments to publish their legal materials, like codes, resolutions, and cases. While deeply passionate about my day job, I am dedicated to using my education to better the community and help the people.</p>

            <section id="Cadyn Yandell">
                <h2>Cadyn Yandell</h2>
                <p>I grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. My heritage is Irish, German, and African American. I present as a white woman with green eyes, fair skin, and light brown hair. My outward identity posed no trouble to my development in an incredibly segregated city. However, my cultural heritage is vastly different from my lived experience in the 2000s. Poverty is intertwined with almost every generation in my heritage. As a child, I felt the constant tension between having enough to get by and keeping our heads above the water. </p>
                <p>I attended a Catholic high school which was a new experience for me culturally and spiritually. I grew up agnostic with influences of Buddhism in my life and was generally opposed to religion. I was drawn to this school out of a desire to continue relationships with the friends I grew up with. I learned that I did not like many things about Catholicism, most notably their perspectives on female modesty. I found the sexualization of high school girls to be distasteful and in direct opposition to what Catholics teach. </p>
                <p>However, this was also the first time I noticed inadequacy between myself and my peers. I was suddenly surrounded by wealthy individuals with strong ties to the Catholic community in Milwaukee. My family had too much money to truly struggle, but not enough money to keep up with my new peers. This tension has followed me into my young adulthood and drives me to break the cycle of financial difficulty in my family for the generations to come. </p>
                <p>In my pursuit of educational attainment and financial stability, I attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison. This is a land grand university, built on the sacred lands of Teejop, home to the Ho-Chunk people. Since my freshman year commencement, the idea that we operate on stolen land has been repeated. However, I still had no appreciation for the complex cultures that existed here before me. </p>
                <p>My first connection to Native cultures was a white Irish science teacher in middle school, Mr. Rauworth. This man married a Native woman and was enthralled with their history and traditions. Although he attempted to integrate native culture into our lesson plans and activities, the weight of Native history was lost on me. </p>
                <p>I did not interact with Native culture again until my senior year of college when I joined the Tribal Court of Appeals Project at UW–Madison. Although I spent the last three years learning about legal studies through my major, I had not yet interacted with Tribal law in any capacity. Over the semester, I found myself climbing a massive learning curve by interacting with the Oneida Tribal Court of Appeals. </p>
                <p>To understand how tribal courts function, I had to partially disengage myself from my American perception of the justice system’s role in civil and legal disputes. I realized that tribal courts play a much larger and more integrated role in their communities. The majority of cases I was presented with handled procedural disputes among business employers and employees. This is in sharp contrast to the appeals cases I would typically read in an American law class.</p> 
                <p>I had to remind myself of my position in this research to appreciate the rightful belonging of our work to the Oneida Tribe. Without a deep understanding of the culture, history, and systems that shape Oneida law, my interpretations and contributions to their work were inherently colonizing. Each data point I created was informed by my American values as a researcher. I realized that the untouched case law that was handed down to me will return to its owner with a new and potentially unappreciative take on their complex legal system.</p> 
                <p>My recent interactions with Native history have undoubtedly affected my self-perception as an American legal scholar at a land grant university. The systems I live by are incredibly different from those embodied 200 to 12,000 years ago by Native nations on this land. I am a twenty-one-year-old Irish, German, and African American woman living and profiting off Teejop land. I am the product of the continued colonization of Native lands, customs, and systems. As I continue to benefit from the erasure of Native culture, I am determined to remember my place on land that is not mine to occupy. Although I cannot restore what has been lost, I can embody the enduring values of community health and environmental sacredness through the lens that I live.</p>
