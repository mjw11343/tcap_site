                <h2>Welcome to the Project!</h2>
                <p><strong>Shekoli!</strong> And welcome to the Tribal Court of Appeals Project. This Project is an educational framework to accomplish the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Serve Tribal Nations by creating a tribally owned database of Tribal Court opinion summaries.</li>
                    <li>Provide law students with legal training in Tribal Law.</li>
                    <li>Give undergraduate students and volunteers pre-law experience in Tribal Law.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The Project partners with Tribal Nation Judiciaries to provide an opportunity for undergraduate students to gain legal experience in exchange for the Tribal Nations receiving a database of opinion summaries that can be used for publishing court reporters. Undergraduate students (and volunteers) summarize Tribal Court opinions into 32+ data points, and law students help review the casework to provide feedback for the undergraduate students.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="works">
                <h2>How It Works.</h2>
                <p>The Project partners with Tribal Nation judiciaries that want to summarize their case opinions. Undergraduate students and volunteers summarize the opinions into a tribally owned database including case summaries, party information, holdings, rules, and case categories/keywords. An Attorney-Instructor and law student teaching team provides instruction and training for the student volunteers.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="process">
                <h2>The Process.</h2>
                <p>The Project works with colleges and universities to provide their undergraduate students with a formal course to engage in the Project. The Project also accepts volunteers to engage in the Project for service hours. The Project runs on a semester cycle, recurring every Fall, Spring, and Summer. The Project is facilitated by an Attorney-Instructor, who manages relationships with the Tribal Nation judiciaries, and provides training for the undergraduate and law students.</p>
                <p>For undergraduate students, they begin with an Introduction to legal analysis, to the Tribal Partners, and to the Project. Before any case work, the students must complete a waiver with the Tribal Nation partner to guarantee that all research product and data is owned by the Tribe. Once students have completed the introductory materials and waiver, they begin casework: summarizing court opinions into the research database. Throughout the semester, students meet weekly one-on-one with the Attorney-Instructor to check-in, address class administration, and review case work. Additionally, students attend weekly lectures which include guest lectures from legal professionals, lessons on Tribal ways of knowing and class discussions on student case briefs. To close the semester, students are provided an opportunity to reflect on their learning and to stay in contact with their classmates and the Project. For assessment, students keep track of their hours for the semester and are graded depending on the number of hours completed.</p>
                <p>For law students, they work with the Attorney-Instructor to help develop legal training materials for the Project and train the undergraduate students. Throughout the semester, the law students meet one-on-one with the undergraduates weekly, facilitate weekly student discussion groups, provide feedback on undergraduate case summaries, and provide regular progress updates to the Attorney-Instructor. Additionally, the law students work with the Attorney-Instructor to address larger course concerns: developing materials on legal training and Tribal Nations, providing critical course feedback to the Attorney-Instructor, brainstorming improvements to the Project, implementing new materials for course instruction, and managing relationships with Tribal Nation partners. Together, the Attorney-Instructor, the law students, and the undergraduate students utilize the Project’s framework to serve Tribal Nations by creating a database of court case summaries.</p>

            <section id="history">
                <h2>The History.</h2>
                <p>The Project’s foundation began in Fall 2022. Then law student, Michael Williams, began interning with the Oneida Nation Judiciary to summarize their Court of Appeals opinions. In this first year, Williams developed a database framework for their opinions and entered 80+ cases into the database. Having experienced many pre-law training programs, Williams saw an opportunity to train pre-law undergraduates with this casework data collection. Using the database, Williams developed the class materials for the Tribal Court of Appeals Project as an opportunity for undergraduates to engage in pre-law experience through completing this casework.</p>
                <p>With support from Professor Erin McBride, Professor Amanda White Eagle, and Attorney Dan Cornelius, Williams pitched the Project to the University of Wisconsin – Madison, Center for Law, Society and Justice. And in Fall 2023, Director Alexandra Huneeus and Program Administrator Martine Delannay approved a pilot class of the Project with 5 students enrolling in Legal Studies 699: Directed Study.</p>
                <p>In the first semester (Fall 2023), 5 students logged 360 hours for the Project and summarized 86 opinions. In the second semester (Spring 2024), 5 students logged 360 hours and summarized 73 opinions.</p>
                <p>After a year of the Project, the Center for Law, Society and Justice offered Williams a contract to lecture for Legal Studies 400: Tribal Court of Appeals Project. With the new course name, the Project added an application process and increased to 15 students per semester. In the third semester of the Project (Fall 2024), 15 students logged 1,244 hours and summarized 130 opinions. And in the fourth semester (Spring 2025), 15 students logged 1,394 hours and summarized 231 opinions.</p>

                <h2>The Partners.</h2>
                <p>The Project has partnered with the following Tribal Nations to summarize their opinions. We are continually seeking to expand our partnerships with Tribal Nations.</p>
                <h3>Oneida Nation Judiciary</h3>

            <section id="framework">
                <h2>The Framework.</h2>
                <p>This project is unique because it provides both a free service and a framework to complete that service.</p>
                <p>The service is summarizing court opinions for Tribal Nations. As developing sovereigns, it is important for Tribal Nations to have this legal data on their court opinions in order to maintain and support their growth. The Project provides this service to help support the continued growth of Tribal sovereignty.</p>
                <p>The Project also offers a framework for summarizing court opinions for Tribal Nations. A framework is “a basic structure underlying a system.” This Project offers a basic structure for a system to summarize case opinions for tribal courts. The Project itself is a series of educational resources for this case summarizing system to function. The framework includes the key players, and the educational resources.</p>
                <p>There are four key players in the framework of the Project: the Tribal Nation partner, the Attorney-Instructor, the law student and the undergraduate. As covered in “The Process” section, each of these key players provides a vital requirement for this project to function. The educational resources are all the documents, diagrams, videos, databases, and other materials developed by this Project to provide this service to Tribal Nations. These educational resources provide the context and tools for the players to facilitate the Project. And these educational resources are available to others who want to facilitate a similar service.</p>
                <p>Which brings up the most important part about this framework: this Project is replicable. With the four key players and the educational resources, this Project can be replicated in many different Tribal communities. More importantly, the framework can be customized and adapted for the community where the work is happening.</p>
